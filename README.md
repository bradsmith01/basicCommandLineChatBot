# basicCommandLineChatBot
This is an idea I had a few time and decided to finally make it one evening. It is a Python command line run programme that lets the user either create a new folder in preset locations, calculate the percentage difference and also the final feature is a day calculator.

The File named 'MyChatBotFuncs.py' is the file that contains all the functions the programme calls upon.
The File named 'chatbot.py' is the main file that when run will run until you wither terminate the programme. Another way to do this is to type 'quit' or 'q' in the command line when asked 'How can I help you?...' by the chatbot.

Future Ideas:
- Add the SpeechRecognition Module
- Add the PyAudio module
- Add more features that help make the user do everyday mundane tasks quicker.
